You can climb the Tor, visit the Rural Life Museum, or browse the many shops purveying New Age essentials.</p>\n<p>The last weekend in June sees the arrival of the internationally renowned Glastonbury Festival, the largest greenfield music and performing arts festival in the world. Croscombe is in fact closer to the festival site than Glastonbury itself, so if you want a slightly more sanitary (and quiet) festival experience The Old Barn is the perfect place to stay for the weekend.</p>\n<h3>Bath</h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><a href=\"http://www.oldbarncroscombe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bath.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/bath-300x261.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Bath in Somerset\" width=\"300\" height=\"261\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-md.jpg 768w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></a>Bath is a remarkably well preserved Georgian spa town located 14 mile away from Croscombe. A world heritage site, Bath has been an important settlement since the Stone Age because of its natural hot springs but it was the Romans who began its development in earnest. Since the 18th century Bath has been an incredibly fashionable place, attracting royalty and celebrities such as Jane Austen. Because of this rich history, modern Bath has much to offer. Visit the Roman baths, stroll along its beautiful Georgian crescents, peruse its chic boutiques or treat yourself to a dip in the thermal spa.</p>\n<h3>Bristol</h3>\n<p>Britain's tenth biggest city Bristol is the region's cultural hub and is located only 20 miles from Croscombe. It boasts some of the finest, best preserved creations of the pioneering Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. His iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge and the SS Great Britain are both worth a visit and afterwards you can have a meal in the Severnshed, also an IKB masterpiece.</p>\n<h3>Street</h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><a href=\"http://www.oldbarncroscombe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/street.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/street-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Greenbank Pool in Street in Somerset\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-md.jpg 768w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://blarked.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></a>The neighbouring town to Glastonbury, and home of Clarks shoes, Street is the perfect place for a bargain hunter. Clarks Village, a large outlet shopping centre, is situated here with shops as varied as Marks and Spencer, Jaeger, Le Creuset, and of course Clarks (both discount and full price). Street also has two swimming pools one of which, Greenbank Pool, is open air. This is the perfect place to spend a day with your family, take a picnic to enjoy in the extensive grounds and have fun in the wet play area as well as the pools.</p>",

We offer cosy self-catered holiday accommodation for up to five people all year round.</p>\n<p>The Barn is a great holiday cottage for those who want to explore the glorious Westcountry, and is within easy reach of the Mendip and Quantock Hills, Wells, Bath, Bristol and Glastonbury.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests, the Barn wasn't always a holiday cottage. In fact it has had a long and varied history. It is thought it began life as the brew house for the church directly opposite and its hospital in the Middle Ages. More recently it was used as a hay barn and as a builder's store.</p>\n<p>The barn was <a href=\"http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=267507&amp;mode=quick\">listed in 1985 by English Heritage</a> (note the English Heritage photo was taken pre-renovation!), an acknowledgement of the barn's historical significance.</p>\n<p>The barn lay unused, unloved and derelict for many years. When we purchased it in 2000 - having lived next door since the early 1970s - the roof was leaking and the interior was jammed with building materials and rubble. We have spent the last ten years converting the barn into a cosy holiday cottage.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Our facilities</h2>\n<p>On the ground floor a large entrance hall opens on to one large fully furnished bedroom with one double bed, one single bed a desk and a chest of drawers. There is also a modern wet room with WC and a shower and a small alcove containing a washing machine. The Barn has underfloor heating which keeps it cosy throughout the year.</p>\n<p>Walking up the solid oak staircase you reach the gallery floor. This is the Barn's main living area containing an open plan kitchen/dining/living space. The kitchen is fully equipped with an electric hob, oven, fridge, microwave/grill as well as cutlery, crockery, cooking utensils etc.</p>\n<p>The living space holds a double futon sofa bed as well as other comfortable chairs. The Barn also has a TV with DVD player and a small selection of DVDs as well as a CD player/radio. The Barn also has free wi-fi for our guests.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>About Somerset</h2>\n<p>Somerset is one of the most beautiful and unspoilt counties in England.

Croscombe is in fact closer to the festival site than Glastonbury itself, so if you want a slightly more sanitary (and quiet) festival experience The Old Barn is the perfect place to stay for the weekend.</p>\n<h3>Bath</h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><a href=\"http://www.oldbarncroscombe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bath.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/bath-300x261.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Bath in Somerset\" width=\"300\" height=\"261\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-xs.jpg 300w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-sm.jpg 480w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-md.jpg 768w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-lg.jpg 1024w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-xl.jpg 1360w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/bath-300x261-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></a>Bath is a remarkably well preserved Georgian spa town located 14 mile away from Croscombe. A world heritage site, Bath has been an important settlement since the Stone Age because of its natural hot springs but it was the Romans who began its development in earnest. Since the 18th century Bath has been an incredibly fashionable place, attracting royalty and celebrities such as Jane Austen. Because of this rich history, modern Bath has much to offer. Visit the Roman baths, stroll along its beautiful Georgian crescents, peruse its chic boutiques or treat yourself to a dip in the thermal spa.</p>\n<h3>Bristol</h3>\n<p>Britain's tenth biggest city Bristol is the region's cultural hub and is located only 20 miles from Croscombe. It boasts some of the finest, best preserved creations of the pioneering Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. His iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge and the SS Great Britain are both worth a visit and afterwards you can have a meal in the Severnshed, also an IKB masterpiece.</p>\n<h3>Street</h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><a href=\"http://www.oldbarncroscombe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/street.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/street-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Greenbank Pool in Street in Somerset\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-xs.jpg 300w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-sm.jpg 480w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-md.jpg 768w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-lg.jpg 1024w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-xl.jpg 1360w ,file:///C:/Users/blark/Documents/Publii/sites/old-barn-croscombe/input/media/posts/2/responsive/street-300x225-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure></a>The neighbouring town to Glastonbury, and home of Clarks shoes, Street is the perfect place for a bargain hunter. Clarks Village, a large outlet shopping centre, is situated here with shops as varied as Marks and Spencer, Jaeger, Le Creuset, and of course Clarks (both discount and full price). Street also has two swimming pools one of which, Greenbank Pool, is open air.
