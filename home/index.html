We offer cosy self-catered holiday accommodation for up to five people all year round.<p></p><p>The Barn is a great holiday cottage for those who want to explore the glorious Westcountry, and is within easy reach of the Mendip and Quantock Hills, Wells, Bath, Bristol and Glastonbury.</p><p>As its name suggests, the Barn wasn't always a holiday cottage. In fact it has had a long and varied history. It is thought it began life as the brew house for the church directly opposite and its hospital in the Middle Ages. More recently it was used as a hay barn and as a builder's store.</p><p>The barn was <a href="http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=267507&amp;mode=quick">listed in 1985 by English Heritage</a> (note the English Heritage photo was taken pre-renovation!), an acknowledgement of the barn's historical significance.</p><p>The barn lay unused, unloved and derelict for many years. When we purchased it in 2000 - having lived next door since the early 1970s - the roof was leaking and the interior was jammed with building materials and rubble. We have spent the last ten years converting the barn into a cosy holiday cottage.</p><h2>Our facilities</h2><p>On the ground floor a large entrance hall opens on to one large fully furnished bedroom with one double bed, one single bed a desk and a chest of drawers. There is also a modern wet room with WC and a shower and a small alcove containing a washing machine. The Barn has underfloor heating which keeps it cosy throughout the year.</p><p>Walking up the solid oak staircase you reach the gallery floor. This is the Barn's main living area containing an open plan kitchen/dining/living space. The kitchen is fully equipped with an electric hob, oven, fridge, microwave/grill as well as cutlery, crockery, cooking utensils etc.</p><p>The living space holds a double futon sofa bed as well as other comfortable chairs. The Barn also has a TV with DVD player and a small selection of DVDs as well as a CD player/radio. The Barn also has free wi-fi for our guests.</p><p> </p><h2>Rates 2022</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Period</th><th>Date from</th><th>Date to</th><th>Nightly rate</th><th>Weekly rate</th></tr><tr><td>Spring</td><td>4th Jan</td><td>2nd Apr</td><td>£85</td><td>£340</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>2nd Apr</td><td>3rd Sep</td><td>£100</td><td>£420</td></tr><tr><td>Glastonbury</td><td>18th Jun</td><td>27th Jun</td><td colspan="2">Please contact for rates</td></tr><tr><td>Autumn</td><td>3rd Sep</td><td>17th Dec</td><td>£85</td><td>£340</td></tr><tr><td>Christmas</td><td>17th Dec</td><td>8th Jan</td><td>£100 (4 night minimum)</td><td>£440</td></tr></tbody></table><p>We generally offer daily or weekly rates (Saturday 4.00pm - Saturday 10.00am) but we have let the Barn for longer periods of time in the past - please contact us for further details.
